This module provide students a way of fast memoizing list of "things". This is a typical
indexing exercise, where a map of coupled things should be learned and retained. We say "thing"
because either key or value could be any related pair of text, images or sounds.
</p>
<p>
This module implements a full Leitner system to mechanically support the memoization process
of the relationships. The couples to be learned are first attached to a deck of cards. These are 
initially considered as difficult to learn. The teacher can choose a learning curve using 2, 3 or 4 decks.
4 decks should be used for large set of definitions. When the student fails answering a card, he will
tell it and let the card stay in the same deck. If he has the correct answer, he will ask for passing the
card to the second deck, so considered as less difficult to learn. The process is repeated for all decks
till the last one where card will remain. The decks are triggered so the student knows which he should 
review. Difficult cards will trigger more often thant trivial cards. Trigger delays are adjustable.
</p>
<p>
When a student do not apply for reviewing decks, cards may downgrade automatically to an higher difficulty
deck.
</p>
<p>
The module allows also a free use of the cards, enabled by module configuration. The module is 
customisable graphically using a teacher defined CSS and image set.
