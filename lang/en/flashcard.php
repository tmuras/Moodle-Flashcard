You may decide to encode this file with some kinds of common separators, on Linux or
Windows systems. The most common may be \"one pair by line\" files, using ':' or comma to
separate questions from answers.

Questions will only comme first, and MUST always have an answer. Empty lines or black lines will be ignored, also those starting with a # or a slash (/).

The importer will make a fast check of the text you want to import. It will reject
the import if the text sequence is not well formed and tell you how many pairs are wrong in the file.

As successfuly importing will erase all data from the decks but also belonging to participants, a confirmation checkbox needs to be checked in to force the import to be performed.";
