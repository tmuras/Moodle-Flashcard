This module provide students a way of fast memoizing list of "things". This is a typical
indexing exercise, where a map of coupled things should be learned and retained. We say "thing"
because either key or value could be any related pair of text, images or sounds.
</p>
<p>
This module implements a full Leitner system to mechanically support the memoization process
of the relationships. The couples to be learned are first attached to a deck of cards. These are
initially considered as difficult to learn. The teacher can choose a learning curve using 2, 3 or 4 decks.
4 decks should be used for large set of definitions. When the student fails answering a card, he will
tell it and let the card stay in the same deck. If he has the correct answer, he will ask for passing the
card to the second deck, so considered as less difficult to learn. The process is repeated for all decks
till the last one where card will remain. The decks are triggered so the student knows which he should
review. Difficult cards will trigger more often thant trivial cards. Trigger delays are adjustable.
</p>
<p>
When a student do not apply for reviewing decks, cards may downgrade automatically to an higher difficulty
deck.
</p>
<p>
The module allows also a free use of the cards, enabled by module configuration. The module is
customisable graphically using a teacher defined CSS and image set.

You may decide to encode this file with some kinds of common separators, on Linux or
Windows systems. The most common may be \"one pair by line\" files, using ':' or comma to
separate questions from answers.

Questions will only comme first, and MUST always have an answer. Empty lines or black lines will be ignored, also those starting with a # or a slash (/).

The importer will make a fast check of the text you want to import. It will reject
the import if the text sequence is not well formed and tell you how many pairs are wrong in the file.

As successfuly importing will erase all data from the decks but also belonging to participants, a confirmation checkbox needs to be checked in to force the import to be performed.";
